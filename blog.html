            <hr>
            <h2 class="text-start m-1">Const :</h2>
            <p class="text-start mb-3">Basically, when you assign a value to a variable when using const, it means that you cannot give that
                variable another value later on. In other words, if you try to change a const variable, you will get an
                error thrown back at you. If you set a const statement inside of a block, however, it will only remain
                inside of that block.Since const is block-scoped, this means that anything you try to do with a const
                variable can only be used within the block of code where you initially wrote it.</p>
            <h2 class="text-start m-1">Const :</h2>
            <p class="text-start mb-3">Similar to const, let also works in terms of block scope. However, it is also similar to var in the fact
                that let does allow you to change its value later on in your code, but more on that in a minute. This
                means that the code below prints 100 instead of 50. If you were to replace let with const in this
                example, you would get an error thrown at you.</p>
            <h2 class="text-start m-1">Const :</h2>
            <p class="text-start mb-3">var and let are very similar in the fact that you can reassign a value later on. The main difference
                between the two though is that let deals with block scope whereas var deals with global scope or
                function scope depending on where it’s declared. As long as your variable isn’t declared within any
                function, var can be used again anywhere else in your code. Also unlike let, var allows you to declare
                the variable as many times as you want and there will be no errors thrown at you.</p>
